Explain what Inheritance is:
Inheritance is where sub-classes inherit fields and methods through a class higher in the hierarchy. that class would be the 
"super" to the subclasses, this can also go infinitely deeper(eg: subclass of subclass), However a class can only have one super
class at a time.

Explain what Polymorphism is:
Polymorphism is the override of a method via a sub-class. It is similar to overloading, however it is done on two seperate files. 
It allows the user to have the ability to morph a method, resulting in more than one use for a method.
